Student Project Recommendation This is an excellent project for a student because it demonstrates:

- Real-time Data Handling : Most student projects are static; using Socket.io shows you understand low-latency communication.
- AI Implementation : You aren't just using a basic API; you've implemented system prompting , personality engineering , and error-correction logic .
- Native Browser APIs : Using the Web Speech API shows deep knowledge of browser capabilities beyond just standard DOM manipulation.
- Professional Engineering Practices : Your code includes rate limiting , security headers , retry logic with backoff , and clean documentation .
Presentation Tip for Interviews :
 "I built a real-time AI English tutor that uses a bidirectional WebSocket connection to provide instantaneous feedback on speech. I chose the Web Speech API for low-latency voice recognition and integrated multiple LLMs via OpenRouter to provide specialized tutoring in grammar, pronunciation, and fluency."
